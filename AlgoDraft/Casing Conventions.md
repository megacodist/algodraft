Consistent casing significantly improves the readability and clarity of AlgoDraft. AlgoDraft adopts specific conventions, closely mirroring practices found in many common programming languages, to help distinguish different types of identifiers at a glance. Adherence to these casing rules is required, as **AlgoDraft** **is case-sensitive**. This means `myVariable`, `MyVariable`, and `MYVARIABLE` would be treated as distinct identifiers within an AlgoDraft script. The following conventions are highly recommended to follow:

1. `ALLUPPERCASE`: All reserved keywords within the AlgoDraft language must be written in all uppercase letters with no delimiters between letters within the keyword itself.
2. `all lower case` for NLDs
3. `camelCase` for variables.
4. `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
5. `PascalCase` for functions and classes.
