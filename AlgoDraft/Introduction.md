Humans need to convey their ideas or exchange ideas with other people. If you want to talk about mathematics, you need to know algebra, set theory, their theoroms, jargons among other things. Pseudocode is the language of algorithms.

It is the general way to express algorithmic ideas.

It is worth mentioning that there is NOT a standard pseudocode that everyone agrees upon.

AlgoDraft is the result of our effort to have the most formal-informal algorithm language: the most formal among all casual contracts and the most informal among all programming languages.

The primary goal of pseudocode is clear, unambiguous, and easy-to-write/read communication of logic.

With collaboration with Google Gemini, I (Megacodist) managed to outlined this pseudocode named AlgoDraft with file extension of .algod.
# Characteristics
Pseudocode is all about logic not implementation.

It must be as higher level as possible if we do not want to say the highest level. The ligh level in programming sense means free from any limiting technology, assuming everything is possible.

AlgoDraft prioritizes clarity and simplicity over strict syntax.

AlgoDraft's primary goal is clear communication of logic.

AlgoDraft must aim at a broad audience or focusing on procedural steps, It would lean towards `$foo AS Integer` because its explicitness prioritizes immediate understanding over symbolic elegance.

AlgoDraft has value-centric philosophy, that is a value is a mathematical value without any computer systems restrictions such as references, addresses, or identity. AlgoDraft does offer typing system but to emphasize what we have at our hands and what we can perform upon it rather than to reminiscent of programming languages.
# Benefits
1.	Pseudocode is a way to think out of the box.
2.	It enables everyone to not limit your train of thoughts to any programming language or framework.
3.	It is possible to employ different levels of abstraction. For example, knowing a prefix in string manipulation is a substring starting from the beginning, we can have all of the following:
