To work with data in AlgoDraft, you need places to store it. This is done using **variables** and **constants**. **Assignment** is the process of placing a value into a variable or constant.

All data containers (variables, constants, parameters, fields, attributes etc.) in AlgoDraft must be prepended with $.
