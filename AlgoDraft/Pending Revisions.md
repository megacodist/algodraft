# Downcasing

One of the use cases of `IS A/AN` operator mentioned in AlgoDraft is downcasing. Please explain it more.

# `IS A/AN`

Right now, this operator only works on objects as follow:

```
<obj> IS A/AN <type_interface>
```

`<obj>` is an object. How about overloading this operator by allowing the left-hand operator to be both an object or a type descriptor.

# RECORD

How about a one-line (or sometimes inline) version of RECORD syntax.
