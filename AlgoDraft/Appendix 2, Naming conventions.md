#  camelCase
## Rule
The first word starts with a lowercase letter. Every new word after that starts with an uppercase letter. There are no spaces or underscores between words.

## Analogy
Imagine the humps of a camel üê™ ‚Äì the uppercase letters are like the humps after the initial lowercase start.

## Examples

* `myVariableName`

* `calculateTotalPrice`

* `userName`

* `loopCounter`

## Common Uses
Often used for variables and functions in languages like Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, and Swift.

# PascalCase or UpperCamelCase
## Rule
Similar to camelCase, but the very first word also starts with an uppercase letter. Every word starts with uppercase. No spaces or underscores.

## Analogy
Think of it as a "taller" camelCase where even the beginning is capitalized, like the start of a proper noun or a title.

## Examples

* `MyVariableName`

* `CalculateTotalPrice`

* `UserName`

* `MainNavigation`

## Common Uses
Very commonly used for naming Classes, Interfaces, Enums, and sometimes Types or Components in languages like Java, C#, JavaScript (especially for classes/components), Swift, and Pascal (where it got its name!).

# snake_case
## Rule
All words are in lowercase. Words are separated by an underscore (_).

## Analogy
Imagine a snake üêç slithering along the ground (all lowercase) with little bumps (the underscores).

## Examples

* my_variable_name

* calculate_total_price

* user_name

* loop_counter

## Common Uses
Very popular in Python for variables and functions. Also common in Ruby, Rust, and often used for database table and column names in SQL.

# SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE or MACRO_CASE
## Rule
All words are in uppercase. Words are separated by an underscore (_).

## Analogy
Like snake_case, but SHOUTING!

## Examples

* MAX_CONNECTIONS

* PI_VALUE

* DEFAULT_TIMEOUT

* API_KEY

## Common Uses
Almost universally used for naming Constants ‚Äì values that are set once and never change during the program's run. You'll see this across many languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, PHP, etc.).

# kebab-case
## Rule
All words are in lowercase. Words are separated by a hyphen (-).

## Analogy
Imagine words skewered like pieces on a kebab stick (the hyphen).

## Examples
* my-variable-name

* calculate-total-price

* user-name

* main-navigation

## Common Uses
You won't usually see this for variable or function names inside most common programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript, because the hyphen (-) is often used for subtraction. However, it's very common in:

* Web Development: CSS class names (.main-content), HTML attributes (data-user-id), URL slugs (/my-blog-post)

* Configuration files

* Sometimes in Lisp-family languages.
